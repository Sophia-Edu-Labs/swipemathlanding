# Focus AIs
For some courses, we've developed Custom Focus AIs in order to best meet the learners' needs. Here you can find the one that is right for you!

## TU Berlin: [Analysis I und Lineare Algebra für Ingenieure](https://app.sophiaedulabs.com/focusai/ana-tub)
This course was designed specifically to prepare you for the Analysis part of the exam. We both took this course, so we know what it takes! 😏

## FU Berlin: [Analysis I für Informatik](https://app.sophiaedulabs.com/focusai/ana-tub)
Of course, we didn't forget our Neighbours in Dahlem 🧸!

## TU Munich: [Analysis I (für Informatik)](https://app.sophiaedulabs.com/focusai/ana-tub)
Growing up in Munich 🥨, TUM is something I've always been proud of. So naturally, there is a Custom Focus-AI for TUM as well!

## LMU Munich: [Analysis I (für Informatik und Statistik)](https://app.sophiaedulabs.com/focusai/ana-tub)

## ETH Zurich: [Analysis I (fürs Informatik)](https://app.sophiaedulabs.com/focusai/ana-tub)
