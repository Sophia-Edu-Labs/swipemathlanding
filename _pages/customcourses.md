# Custom AIs
For some courses, we've developed Custom Focus AIs in order to best meet the learners' needs. Here you can find the one that is right for you!

## TU Berlin: [Analysis I und Lineare Algebra für Ingenieure](https://app.sophiaedulabs.com/focusai/ana-tub)
This course was designed specifically to prepare you for the Analysis part of the exam. We both took this course, so we know what it takes! 😏
