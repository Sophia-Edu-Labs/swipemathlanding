**# SwipeMath for Schools**

SwipeMath is perfectly suited to cater to the individual strengths and weaknesses of students. Our AI recognizes the strengths and weaknesses of the students and then individually provides the right tasks and explanations. We currently have two offerings in the school context: **state-specific Abitur / Matura Courses** for self-study and **Class-specific courses**, which we are happy to create free of charge upon request from teachers!

**## State-Specific Abitur / Matura Course**

We offer free AI trainers for the stochastics and analysis parts of the Abitur.

**## Class-Specific Courses**

If you are a teacher at a German-speaking school, we would be happy to create a course for your class that is tailored exactly to your teaching content. Simply send us an [email](mailto:friedrich@sophiaedulabs.com) stating your school, class, and the content you would like to have. We look forward to hearing from you!
